# LeadScoring

Used Logistic regression modeling to put scores to every lead based on the possibility of it converting into a customer for a Online Education based company. Outcomes: The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model was almost similar to our training set (78%, 83% and 75%), hence concluding the model worked well.
